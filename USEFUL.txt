Keeping track of some links here, in no particular order. E.g. stuff that has
helped, stuff that might yet help, implied thanks, etc.

https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/from-docker-container-to-bootable-linux-disk-image/
- gave me some of the clues I needed re: image-conversion (docker->qemu)

https://github.com/wagoodman/dive
- something that might come in handy, ref'd from the previously noted webpage.
- analysis of docker images in their inheritence chain, filesystem overheads, etc.

https://github.com/lindenb/makefile2graph
- appears quite old, perhaps there's something newer? I haven't played with
  this yet.
- ability to visually represent the directed graph of a makefile.
