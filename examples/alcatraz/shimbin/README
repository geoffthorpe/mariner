The idea here is;
- we have this directory that can be put on the user's PATH,
- it contains named symlinks to our shim script (alcatraz.sh), and those names
  exactly match the executables we'd like to spawn in our alcatraz container
  image (which must be in the PATH of the corresponding user account inside the
  container image).
- when invoked by symlink, alcatraz.sh will use $0 (the name of the symlink) to
  start up the container and run the desired tool.
